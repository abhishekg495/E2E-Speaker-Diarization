# SPEAKER DIARIZATION USING PYTHON
After training and testing the model, run dvector_create.py to create the numpy files train_sequence.npy, train_cluster_ids.npy, test_sequence.npy, and test_cluster_ids.npy. 

These files can be loaded and used to train the uis-rnn model found at https://github.com/google/uis-rnn
